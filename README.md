# Challenge Description

We want to understand you better, so do not be afraid of failing, this is not a right or wrong matter. Just do your best. Good luck!


## Goal

Your team is developing an application for users to create and explore tourist spots on a map. Your task is to create a Web application to consume and register this information.


## Non-functional specs

* You may use plain Javascript, but we encourage you to use TypeScript if you feel comfortable to.
* You may choose to use a framework, but if you are feeling really badass, do without it.
* You may use a css pre-processor, webpack, babel and others.
* You may use any piece of technology you think is necessary or cool.
* It must be builded in components.
* Serviceless, you need to use the browser's technologies to consume and save data. Use what you prefer. Pure language, libs, tools, you decide.
* It must be easy to setup and deploy.
* Do your best.
